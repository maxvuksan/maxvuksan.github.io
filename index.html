                <label>Initial tunnel concept</label>
                <div class="desc">Very early into the project we realized that our games tunnels needed to be modular. 
                    Our solution utilizes start and end anchor points for each segment which would snap together when generated. A benefit of this is that tunnel segments can be any length, enabling greater variety than fixed length segments.

                <div class="desc">Given our project is aiming to be very atmospheric, the Unity High Definition Render Pipeline is something we wanted to utilize, 
                    particularly looking into its volumetric fog effects for our games tunnel sequences. Unfortunately its performance was not suitable for VR.

                    Aiming for the smallest rendering overhead, I ensured that each model had a very low vertex count 
                    while also utilizing a texture atlas allowing for everything to be drawn in a single draw call.

                <div class="desc">Something discussed briefly as a group was the motivation for your actions, <br><br><em>"Why does the player need to stop at every station?"</em><br><br>
                    Our idea was that at every stop the player must repair/maintain the train (whether that be refueling, repairing an electrical fault, etc...) in order to keep progressing. To create urgency we also discussed introducing
                    a timer of sorts, meaning the player could only stay at a station for X amount of time, or something catastrophic would happen.

                    We settled for cold spot lights to litter the stations and a warm well lit train interior. Additionally I created a
                    bright red industrial light to illuminate the tunnels.

                for our environment, Additionally I created a variety of one shot sound effects to be played on a per event basis. 
                All the audio produced for the project was created/manipulated using Ableton Live

            <div class="desc">Additional to gameplay/environmental sounds, We planned the game would have some sort of ending with associated music.

                <label>Scripts</label>
                <div class="desc">Given the tedious nature of managing Audio Sources in Unity, I reused and enhanced an existing AudioManager that I created for an earlier project.
                    The AudioManager allows one shot sound effects to be played programmatically. This script utilizes a pool of objects which fill the required sounds needs (position, volume, pitch)

                <img src="content/photos/AudioManager.png">
                <img src="content/photos/CodeSoundExample.png">

                <div class="desc">In addition to one shot sounds, we needed a way seamlessly introduce and remove looping audio tracks.<br><br>
                For example, when the player enters the station, ominous ambience should fade in. Or when the train is in motion, a rhythmic rumble should play to 
                communicate the train on the tracks.<br><br>
                the Looping Audio Manager addresses these issues, enabling us to programmatically fade in and out looping sounds with a single function call. Additionally, to provide variation
                each loop can be configured to modulate its volume over time.
